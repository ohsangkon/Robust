# Robust (Robust regressions with nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator)
The ordinary least squares (OLS) method is commonly used for estimating regression coefficients for the linear regression. 
However, this approach is highly sensitive to influential outliers and loses efficiency when the error follows a skewed or heavy-tailed distribution. To address these limitations, we propose using a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for the scale factor in skew-normal scale mixture in order to mitigate the risk of misspecification issues and produce robust estimators without any model selection procedure.
